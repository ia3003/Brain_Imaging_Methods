The experiment comprises of two parts: a colour discrimination task and a colour naming task. Both tasks use 40 colour hues.

In the colour discrimination task, a reference colour will be presented followed by a pair of distractor colours. Match the correct distractor colour
by pressing the left or the right arrow keys.

In the colour naming task, each colour appears on the screen. Then, you can type the names of the colour in the dialog box.
All the data is saved in a csv file using the Participant ID. For each run, two csv files are created, one for each of the tasks mentioned above.

Raw data collected from 4 participants are uploaded in the Data folder.
